       "      <td>Alex Cross is a crime, mystery, and thriller novel series written by James Patterson. The protagonist of the series is Alex Cross, an African-American Metropolitan Police Department detective and father who counters threats to his family and to the city of Washington, D.C. Supporting characters include two of Cross's children, Damon and Janelle, as well as his grandmother Nana Mama. The series is usually narrated in first-person perspective by Alex Cross, and occasionally from the villains' point of view in third-person.\\nThe series began in 1993 and is ongoing. Nearly all the stories have made bestsellers lists and garnered favorable reviews, especially Double Cross; Cross Fire; I, Alex Cross; and Alex Cross, Run.\\nThe series is published worldwide, with Little, Brown currently holding publication rights in the United States, in paperback, hardcover, and audiobook editions. The first book in the series, Along Came a Spider, was released in 1993 to positive reviews, spawning a series of over twenty subsequent novels. The series has resulted in three movies, Kiss the Girls (1997), Along Came a Spider (2001), and Alex Cross (2012).\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Poisonwood Bible (1998), by Barbara Kingsolver, is a best-selling novel about a missionary family, the Prices, who in 1959 move from the U.S. state of Georgia to the village of Kilanga in the Belgian Congo, close to the Kwilu River. \\nThe novel's title refers to Bible errata. The father of the family creates his own \"misprint\" of the Bible. He concludes his sermons with the Kikongo expression \"Tata Jesus is bängala\" with the intent of saying \"Jesus is most precious\". In his hurried mispronunciation, he actually says \"Jesus is poisonwood\".</td>\n",

The father of the family creates his own \"misprint\" of the Bible. He concludes his sermons with the Kikongo expression \"Tata Jesus is bängala\" with the intent of saying \"Jesus is most precious\". In his hurried mispronunciation, he actually says \"Jesus is poisonwood\".   \n",
